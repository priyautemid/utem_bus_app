# UTeMQuickBusApplication

This project was developed as a solution to the common problem of unpredictable bus waiting times. The application was built to track buses in real-time, providing users with accurate estimated arrival times based on live data. The system is designed to offer a seamless, cross-platform experience across both Android and iOS devices, using Flutter as the framework.

## Features

Cross-Platform Development: Built using Flutter, ensuring the app is compatible with both iOS and Android devices. This allows the application to reach a broader audience without needing to build separate native apps for each platform.

Real-Time Bus Tracking: Utilizes IoT sensor data installed on the buses to provide real-time tracking. This data is collected via onboard sensors that communicate with the app, allowing users to track buses with precision.

Google Maps Integration: Leveraging Google Maps API, the app displays the live location of buses on the map, offering real-time updates on bus positions. The Google Maps API is used for route visualization, showing both the current and predicted routes of buses.

Firebase Data Management: Data flow management is handled via Firebase, which allows for real-time synchronization of bus location updates and route data. Firebase's cloud storage ensures that all bus data is updated across all user devices instantly without any delays.

Cloud Synchronization with Google Cloud Platform: The Google Cloud APIs enable efficient and fast data synchronization across devices. With Google Cloud, the app ensures that the data remains up-to-date, providing users with the most accurate information at all times.

Seamless User Experience: Users receive notifications and updates in real-time, allowing them to plan their trips with confidence. The system is designed to handle high volumes of real-time data, ensuring a smooth and lag-free experience even during peak hours.

## Installation Instructions:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bus-tracking-app.git
flutter pub get


## Future Improvements:

Predictive Analytics: Implement predictive algorithms to forecast bus arrival times more accurately, factoring in traffic conditions, delays, and route changes.
User Account Management: Add functionality for users to save their frequently used routes or receive personalized notifications about bus schedules.
